# Servo_motor

This program changes the position setting of a servomotor using PWM, based on data read over the serial port.
Depending on the character that has been read, the program will change the servomotor position, or report requested data over the serial port.
The user may also select or deselect a mode, whereby the servomotor position is set by the ADC value.
